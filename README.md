# Travian-Manager
Python script, for tasks automation. Using Python and Selenium web driver,
The script is aimed for a web browser game called Travian Kingdoms.
The user inputs the tasks into text files, the application reads from it, executes tasks, and update the text files.
Their are some configuration steps to use the application, I will provide them later.
The script is still under development !!! Only Construction Orders list is currently functional.
